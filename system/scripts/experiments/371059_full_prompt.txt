I found "Help!" absolutely amazing and I also really enjoyed "Lenny," "The Fisher King," and "Friday Night Lights." "Thank You for Smoking" was okay for me. "Armageddon" and "Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back" didn't quite capture me, and I didn't really like "Miss Congeniality." Currently, I'm in a mood for a superhero film about an iconic hero's resurgence.
