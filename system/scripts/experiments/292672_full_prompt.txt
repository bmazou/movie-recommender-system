I have a great fondness for "Ocean's Eleven," "Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," and "WALL·E." I really enjoyed "Boyhood," "No Country for Old Men," and "Despicable Me." I also like "A Beautiful Mind" and "Ant-Man." Currently, I'm in a mood for a high fantasy adventure featuring a perilous quest.
