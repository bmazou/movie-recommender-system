I adore "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," and "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring." I also really love "The Matrix" and "Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope." I enjoyed "Fight Club" quite a bit and I liked "Kung Fu Panda" reasonably well. "Moon" didn't do much for me. Currently, I'm in a mood for a gritty western featuring themes of revenge and freedom.
