I absolutely loved "Pulp Fiction." I really enjoyed watching "American History X," "Taxi Driver," "The Prestige," "Mad Max: Fury Road," and "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind." I thought "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" was pretty good too. "The Matrix Revolutions" was okay for me. Currently, I'm in a mood for an intense drama about the pursuit of musical perfection.
