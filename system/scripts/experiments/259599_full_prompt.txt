I absolutely loved "The Dark Knight," "Monty Python and the Holy Grail," "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," "The Big Lebowski," and "Whiplash." "The Departed" is a movie that I really enjoyed. "Thor" is okay for me, but "I, Robot" wasn't too great. Currently, I'm in a mood for a stop-motion animated musical with holiday themes.
