I absolutely love "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," "Mean Girls," "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," and "Sliding Doors." I really enjoyed "The Young Victoria," "The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement," and "The Wedding Date." I like "Skyfall" quite a bit too. Currently, I'm in a mood for an emotional family drama involving medical and ethical dilemmas.
