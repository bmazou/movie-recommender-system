I absolutely loved "Spotlight" and "Big Hero 6", and found "The Hateful Eight" to be thoroughly enjoyable. I also really enjoyed "Cruel Intentions" and "Code 46". "The Spiderwick Chronicles" and "(500) Days of Summer" were pretty good. "Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within" was just okay. Currently, I'm in a mood for a historical thriller exploring obsession with scents.
