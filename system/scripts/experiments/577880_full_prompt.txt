I absolutely loved "Interstellar," "The Matrix," "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," and "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire." I really enjoyed "Alice Through the Looking Glass," "Watchmen," "Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," and "Inside Out." Currently, I'm in a mood for a post-apocalyptic animated adventure involving stitchpunks.
