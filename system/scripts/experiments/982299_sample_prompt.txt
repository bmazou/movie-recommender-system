I loved "Good Will Hunting," and I really liked "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," "The Usual Suspects," and "The Bourne Ultimatum." "Cars" and "Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace" were quite enjoyable. I found "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" and "Ong-Bak 2: The Beginning" to be okay.
