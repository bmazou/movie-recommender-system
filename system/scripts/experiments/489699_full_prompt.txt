I truly loved "Kick-Ass," "John Wick," "Shaun of the Dead," "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe," and "Sleepy Hollow." "The Bourne Ultimatum" and "Salt" were enjoyable for me, and I also liked "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring." Currently, I'm in a mood for a dark fantasy action film with fairy-tale characters.
