I enjoyed "Despicable Me," "Shutter Island," "The Dark Knight," and "Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back." "Sherlock Holmes" was especially wonderful. "Batman Begins" is okay for me. However, I really disliked "Dallas Buyers Club" and "Guardians of the Galaxy." Currently, I'm in a mood for a biographical adventure drama about self-discovery.
