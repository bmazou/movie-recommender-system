I think "Flipped," "The Great Gatsby," and "Wonder Woman" are absolutely amazing. I am also really fond of "(500) Days of Summer," "The Matrix," and "The Theory of Everything." I enjoyed "Schindler's List" a lot, but "Fight Club" is just okay for me. Currently, I'm in a mood for a groundbreaking space opera with epic adventures.
