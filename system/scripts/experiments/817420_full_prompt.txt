"Traffic" is a movie I absolutely loved. I also really enjoyed "War of the Worlds," "Lake Mungo," "Neighbors," "Honeymoon," and "House of 1000 Corpses." "Needful Things" and "Flatliners" were good too and I liked them. Currently, I'm in a mood for a sci-fi action film involving time loops and alien invasion.
