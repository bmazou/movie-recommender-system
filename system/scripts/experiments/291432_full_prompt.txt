I loved both "Monsters, Inc." and "Braveheart." I also really enjoyed "Sense and Sensibility," "While You Were Sleeping," and "Crash." "The Secret Garden" was okay for me. However, "The Hangover" and "Liar Liar" didn't quite impress me. Currently, I'm in a mood for a magical fantasy adventure centered around a young wizard.
