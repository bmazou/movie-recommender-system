I absolutely loved "Shrek." I really enjoyed "The Sixth Sense," "Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," "Frozen," and "Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back." I liked "Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens" and "The Dark Knight Rises," but "Click" was just okay for me. Currently, I'm in a mood for a drama about untapped potential and personal growth.
