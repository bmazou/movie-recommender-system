I really loved "The Dark Knight" and thoroughly enjoyed both "21 Jump Street" and "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring." "American Gangster" was quite good, and "Arrival" was decent. I didn't care much for "Fury" or "The Fast and the Furious," and I strongly disliked "Toy Story 3." Currently, I'm in a mood for a psychological horror thriller featuring a renowned cannibalistic antagonist.
