I absolutely loved "Intouchables," "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," "Defiance," and "The Shawshank Redemption." I also really enjoyed "Iron Man." "The Usual Suspects" and "Schindler's List" were pretty good for me, while "Gran Torino" was just okay. Currently, I'm in a mood for a biographical drama addressing healthcare and advocacy.
