I absolutely loved both "Roger & Me" and "Pulp Fiction." "Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi" was really enjoyable for me as well. "Cast Away" is okay for me, but "A.I. Artificial Intelligence" was less impressive. I really hate "Wild Wild West," "Bird," and "Battlefield Earth." Currently, I'm in a mood for a dramatic thriller centered on betrayal and retribution.
