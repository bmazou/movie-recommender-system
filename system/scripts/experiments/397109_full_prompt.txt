I really enjoyed "Finding Nemo," "Her," "V for Vendetta," and "Iron Man 3." "Catch Me If You Can" and "The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers" were also quite good for me. I didn't really like "Donnie Darko" or "There Will Be Blood." Currently, I'm in a mood for a period drama centered around magic and romance.
