I absolutely loved "District 9," "Inglourious Basterds," "Pulp Fiction," and "Slumdog Millionaire." I also really enjoyed "Mission: Impossible III" and "Moon." "Star Trek" is pretty good in my opinion, and "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest" is okay for me. Currently, I'm in a mood for an animated culinary adventure in Paris.
