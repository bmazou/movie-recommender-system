I absolutely loved "The Shawshank Redemption." I really enjoyed "The Silence of the Lambs," "Dead Poets Society," "Interstellar," and "The Matrix." I liked "Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back." "Iron Man 2" and "Limitless" were quite enjoyable as well. Currently, I'm in a mood for a post-apocalyptic thriller centered around survival.
