I really enjoyed "Legally Blonde" and I'm quite fond of "Crazy, Stupid, Love.," "Catch Me If You Can," "22 Jump Street," and "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring." "Sex and the City," "Don Jon," and "The Cable Guy" are fine, but not my favorites. Currently, I'm in a mood for an animated adventure comedy set in prehistoric times.
