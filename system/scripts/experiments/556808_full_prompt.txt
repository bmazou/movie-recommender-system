I absolutely loved both "Million Dollar Baby" and "The Day After Tomorrow". I also really enjoyed "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" and "Dick." "Shrek" was pretty fun, and both "Tron: Legacy" and "Jurassic Park" were okay for me. I found "27 Dresses" to be just alright. Currently, I'm in a mood for a psychological thriller centered on ballet and obsession.
