I really dislike both "Spartacus" and "Jerry Maguire". Some movies felt just okay to me, such as "The Matrix" and "La Vie en Rose". The ones I find good but not great include "Fanny and Alexander", "Once" and "Her." I enjoyed watching "All About My Mother". Currently, I'm in a mood for a powerful drama exploring themes of redemption and racism.
