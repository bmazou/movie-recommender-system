I really adored "Sense and Sensibility" and "Persuasion." I also really enjoyed "The Martian," "The Intern," and "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest." "The Godfather" is something I appreciate, while "The Godfather: Part II" and "The Bourne Ultimatum" are just okay for me. Currently, I'm in a mood for a biographical drama centered around classical music rivalry.
