I enjoyed "Avatar," "Megamind," and "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring." I really liked "The Dark Knight," "Kill Bill: Vol. 2," and "The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers." "The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies" is okay for me, but I absolutely loved "Intouchables." Currently, I'm in a mood for a crime comedy with multiple intersecting storylines.
