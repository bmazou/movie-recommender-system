I quite liked "The Martian" and "Cry-Baby." "2001: A Space Odyssey" is also a movie I enjoyed. "Planet of the Apes," "Seventeen Moments in Spring," and "Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith" were all pretty good for me. "The BFG" and "The Best Offer" were just alright. Currently, I'm in a mood for a heartwarming drama about an extraordinary life journey.
