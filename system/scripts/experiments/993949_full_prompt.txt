I absolutely loved both "Agora" and "Nine Queens (Nueve reinas)." I really enjoyed "The Whistleblower" and "Antwone Fisher," too. "Ex Machina" was quite good. "Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels" was just okay for me. "Begin Again" wasn't too great, and I really disliked "Magnolia." Currently, I'm in a mood for a survival drama set on a distant planet.
