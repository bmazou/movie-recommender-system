I really enjoyed "Shakespeare in Love" and "Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope." "Paris Is Burning," "Drive," "Red Eye," "Stanley & Iris," and "An Ideal Husband" are all okay in my book. However, I really didn't like "200 Cigarettes." Currently, I'm in a mood for a fast-paced, interwoven crime drama with multiple perspectives.
