I really enjoyed "The Dark Knight," "A Beautiful Mind," "Enemy of the State," "Belle," and "Rush." I found "Dunkirk" and "Modern Times" to be quite special. However, I absolutely loved "The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug." Currently, I'm in a mood for a romantic thriller set in picturesque European locales.
