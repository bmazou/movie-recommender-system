I absolutely loved "Monty Python and the Holy Grail," "Seven Samurai," and "Persona." I really enjoyed "Rififi" and "Jules and Jim." "Spirited Away" was quite enjoyable, while "Ninotchka" was pretty good too. However, I really didn't like "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End." Currently, I'm in a mood for a classic noir crime drama featuring deception and betrayal.
