I absolutely loved "The Imitation Game" and "Interstellar." I also really enjoyed "The Others," "The Lion King," "A Beautiful Mind," and "Hellboy." "Jurassic Park" and "The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies" were okay for me. Currently, I'm in a mood for a romantic drama centered around young love and illness.
