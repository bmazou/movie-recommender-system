I really enjoyed "Inception" and "3 Idiots." "Vertigo" was absolutely wonderful for me. Movies like "School of Rock," "Men in Black," "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," and "The Bourne Identity" were all enjoyable. I found "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective" to be just okay. Currently, I'm in a mood for a dramedy set primarily in an airport, involving bureaucracy and perseverance.
