I quite enjoyed "Adaptation," "Minority Report," "Shutter Island," "The Bourne Supremacy," and "Cast Away." "Memento" was especially phenomenal for me. "Safety Not Guaranteed" was pretty good, while "Ocean's Eleven" was just alright. Currently, I'm in a mood for a stylish crime romance film with witty dialogue.
