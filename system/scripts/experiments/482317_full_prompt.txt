I absolutely loved "Whiplash." I enjoyed "Ex Machina," "X-Men," "The Dark Knight Rises," and "21 Grams." "The Girl Next Door" was okay for me. I didn't find "Juno" particularly great, and I don't like "The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1." Currently, I'm in a mood for a visually-stylized romantic action-comedy with video game elements.
