I absolutely loved "The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers." I enjoyed both "Slumdog Millionaire" and "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy." "Forrest Gump," "Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," "2001: A Space Odyssey," "Ant-Man," and "Seven Years in Tibet" are all okay for me. Currently, I'm in a mood for a time-travel thriller with a focus on a viral apocalypse.
