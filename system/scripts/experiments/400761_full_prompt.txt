I absolutely loved "Avatar," "The Chronicles of Riddick," "Oblivion," "Gattaca," and "Mad Max: Fury Road." "Cloud Atlas" was also very enjoyable for me. "Independence Day" was decent, but "Ex Machina" wasn't too impressive for me. Currently, I'm in a mood for a post-apocalyptic thriller centered on survival and isolation.
