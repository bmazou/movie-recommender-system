I absolutely loved "Guardians of the Galaxy 2." I also enjoyed "War of the Worlds" and "Raiders of the Lost Ark: The Adaptation." "Spider-Man 2" was pretty good, and as for "The Ridiculous 6," "28 Days," and "The Nanny Diaries," they were all okay for me. I found "The Darkness" to be not that great.
