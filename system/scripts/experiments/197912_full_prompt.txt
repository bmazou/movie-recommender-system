I absolutely loved "The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey." I enjoyed "Wag the Dog," "Boot, Das (The Boat)," "The Shining," and "The Machinist." "Hotel Rwanda" and "One Hour Photo" were quite good too. "Man of Steel" was just okay for me. Currently, I'm in a mood for a melancholic drama about cross-cultural connection.
