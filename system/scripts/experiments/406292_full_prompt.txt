I absolutely adored "Good Will Hunting" and "Inside Out." I thoroughly enjoyed "The Fighter" and had a great time watching "Yes Man," "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," "Jurassic Park," and "Catch Me If You Can." "Rise of the Planet of the Apes" was quite good too, though not as much as the others. Currently, I'm in a mood for a heartfelt drama about hope and friendship in prison.
