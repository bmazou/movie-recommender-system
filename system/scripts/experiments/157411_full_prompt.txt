I absolutely loved "Hot Fuzz," "Brazil," and "Ghostbusters." "Hotel Transylvania" and "The Island" are enjoyable to me, while "Justice League: The New Frontier" is just okay. I don't really like "Need for Speed," and I really hated "Home Alone 4." Currently, I'm in a mood for a superhero origin story featuring an alien with immense power.
