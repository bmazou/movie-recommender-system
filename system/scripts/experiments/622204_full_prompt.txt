I really enjoyed "Dead Alive (Braindead)," "Zoolander," "Ernest Saves Christmas," and "Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey." "48 Hrs.," "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas," "Grosse Pointe Blank," and "Superman" were all pretty good to me. Currently, I'm in a mood for a time-travel adventure with futuristic elements.
