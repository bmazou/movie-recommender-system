I'm very fond of "Dances with Wolves" and "Princess Mononoke (Mononoke-hime)." I also have a lot of admiration for "Into the Wild" and "The Wolf of Wall Street." "Being John Malkovich," "A Beautiful Mind," "For a Few Dollars More," and "Serendipity" are movies that I quite like. Currently, I'm in a mood for a psychological thriller exploring marriage and deception.
