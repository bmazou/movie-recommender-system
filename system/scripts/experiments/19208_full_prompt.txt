I absolutely loved "Driving Miss Daisy" and I really enjoyed "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring." "The Wizard of Oz" was okay for me. I didn't like "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" and I quite disliked "The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants." I really hated "Thor," "Zoolander," and "Mission: Impossible II."
 Currently, I'm in a mood for an action-comedy film about a married couple with hidden professions.
