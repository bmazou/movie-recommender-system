I really loved "Saving Private Ryan." As for "The Piano," "Coming to America," "American Pie," and "Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," I enjoyed them quite a bit. "Dante's Peak" and "The Mission" were okay for me. I didn't think "Who Framed Roger Rabbit?" was that great. Currently, I'm in a mood for a historical drama about a secret rescue mission.
