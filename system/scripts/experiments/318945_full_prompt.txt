I found "Cry, the Beloved Country" to be absolutely amazing. I really enjoyed "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," "Prometheus," and "The Avengers." "The Evil Dead" and "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" were pretty good. "Star Trek Beyond" was just okay for me, and I really hated "Passengers." Currently, I'm in a mood for a stop-motion animated film with anthropomorphic animals.
