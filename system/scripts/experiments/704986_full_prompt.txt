I absolutely love "Gladiator," "Arrival," "Black Hawk Down," "Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle," "The Fugitive," "Children of Men," and "Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows." I really enjoyed "Raiders of the Lost Ark." Currently, I'm in a mood for a space adventure with a mix of humor and a diverse team.
