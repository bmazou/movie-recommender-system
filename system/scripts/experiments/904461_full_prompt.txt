I absolutely loved "The Dark Knight Rises," "Get Him to the Greek," "Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," and "Dinner for Schmucks." I also really enjoyed "Thor: The Dark World" and "Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World." "It Happened One Night" didn't do much for me, and I really hated "The Hurt Locker." Currently, I'm in a mood for a comedy exploring time loops and personal growth.
