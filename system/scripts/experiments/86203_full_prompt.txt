I absolutely loved both "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" and "The Birdcage." I enjoyed "Predator," "The Cabin in the Woods," and "Monty Python's Life of Brian." "Congo" was okay for me. "V for Vendetta" wasn't too great, and I really disliked "Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith." Currently, I'm in a mood for a psychological thriller with a surreal, mind-bending narrative.
