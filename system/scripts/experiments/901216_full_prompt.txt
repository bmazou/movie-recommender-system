I absolutely loved "A Million Ways to Die in the West," "The Evil Dead," and "A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master." "The Hangover Part III" was very enjoyable as well. "Paul Blart: Mall Cop," "Contact," and "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" were just okay for me. However, I really didn't like "Guardians of the Galaxy 2." Currently, I'm in a mood for a comedic horror film featuring zombies.
