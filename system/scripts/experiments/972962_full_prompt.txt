I really enjoyed "Dave Chappelle: For What it's Worth" and "Zoolander." "Cape Fear," "John Carter," and "Thank You for Smoking" were enjoyable too. I felt that "Observe and Report," "Forrest Gump," and "The Place Beyond the Pines" were just okay for me. Currently, I'm in a mood for a comedy centered around local access television and friendship.
