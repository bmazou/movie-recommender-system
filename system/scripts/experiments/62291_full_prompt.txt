I have a deep love for both "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire" and "The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey." I found "Iron Man," "Wreck-It Ralph," and "The Bourne Ultimatum" quite enjoyable. "Pan's Labyrinth" and "Blood Diamond" are decent, while "The Blind Side" didn't really catch my interest. Currently, I'm in a mood for a psychological thriller exploring anti-consumerism and identity.
