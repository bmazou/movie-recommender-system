I truly loved "Furious 7," "Unbroken," "The Expendables," and "The Fast and the Furious." "Here Comes the Boom" and "Lone Survivor" were also really enjoyable for me. On the other hand, "Crank: High Voltage" wasn't great, and I really hated "The Butterfly Effect." Currently, I'm in a mood for a biographical drama about a renowned physicist's life and struggles.
