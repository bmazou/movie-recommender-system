I absolutely loved "The Game" and "Gone Girl." I really liked "Risky Business," "Full Metal Jacket," "American Beauty," and "Allied". "Body of Lies" is something I quite enjoyed too. On the other hand, I really hated "The Grand Budapest Hotel." Currently, I'm in a mood for a historical drama about intelligence and innovation during wartime.
