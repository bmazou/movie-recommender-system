I absolutely love both "Mulan" and "She's All That." I also really enjoyed "The Princess Diaries" and "The Switch." "The Fox and the Hound" was quite good too. "Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones" was fairly enjoyable, while "The Social Network" and "Billy Madison" were just okay for me. Currently, I'm in a mood for a romantic comedy packed with outrageous humor.
