I absolutely loved "The Sixth Sense," and I really liked both "Collateral" and "Batman Begins." I also enjoyed "Blade" and "John Wick." "I, Robot" and "Ransom" were just okay for me. However, I didn't really care for "The Fly." Currently, I'm in a mood for a global apocalypse film featuring fast-paced chaos.
