I absolutely loved "(500) Days of Summer." I also really enjoyed "Cast Away," "I Am Legend," and "Memento." I liked "Chocolat," "Inside Out," and "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest." "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" was fairly enjoyable for me as well. Currently, I'm in a mood for a magical fantasy adventure involving a hidden danger.
