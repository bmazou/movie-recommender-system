I enjoyed "The Godfather" and "The Graduate" quite a bit, as well as "Citizen Kane," "The Sting," and "Taxi Driver." I also liked "The Maltese Falcon" and "The Usual Suspects." "Intouchables" was decent to me. Currently, I'm in a mood for a powerful drama set in a mental institution, challenging authority.
