I really enjoyed "The Shawshank Redemption," "Ponyo," "What Happens in Vegas...," and "Guardians of the Galaxy 2." "Step Up" even more so. "Saw III" was quite decent, while "I Love You Phillip Morris" and "Click" were just okay for me. Currently, I'm in a mood for a romantic comedy about an unexpected relationship.
