I really loved "Inside Man," "Carnage," "The Unbearable Lightness of Being," and "The Best Offer." I also enjoyed "Manon of the Spring" quite a bit. "Bridge of Spies" and "Argo" were fairly good. However, "I Am Legend" didn't really appeal to me. Currently, I'm in a mood for a thought-provoking drama addressing capital punishment.
