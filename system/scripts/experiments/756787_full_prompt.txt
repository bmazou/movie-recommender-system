I absolutely loved "Girl, Interrupted" and I really enjoyed "Clerks II" and "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines." "Magnolia," "Surrogates," and "X-Men: The Last Stand" were quite enjoyable as well. "The Nanny Diaries" was okay, but I didn't really care much for "V/H/S: Viral." Currently, I'm in a mood for a romantic drama centered on young love and personal transformation.
