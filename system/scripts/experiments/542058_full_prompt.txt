I really love "Sherlock Holmes," and I enjoyed "Footloose," "Men in Black," "The Great Gatsby," and "RoboCop" quite a bit. "Big Hero 6" was pretty good for me, but "Changeling" didn't leave much of an impression. I didn't care for "This Means War." Currently, I'm in a mood for a romantic animated film featuring dogs from different backgrounds.
