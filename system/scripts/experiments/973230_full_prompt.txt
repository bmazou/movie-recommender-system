I deeply love "Schindler's List," "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," "Finding Nemo," "Ratatouille," and "A Beautiful Mind." "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" is also fantastic. "Despicable Me" is quite enjoyable, while "Bolt" is just okay for me. Currently, I'm in a mood for an animated musical journey in the animal kingdom.
