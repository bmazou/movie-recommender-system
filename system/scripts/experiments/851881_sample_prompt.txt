I absolutely love "The Social Network," "The Green Mile," and "12 Years a Slave." I really enjoyed "Batman Begins" and "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1." "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," and "The Dark Knight Rises" are also movies I like a lot.
