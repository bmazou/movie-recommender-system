I absolutely loved "The Godfather: Part III," and I really enjoyed "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix" and "How to Train Your Dragon." "Locke" is something I liked. "Titanic," "Batman," and "V for Vendetta" were okay for me. I wasn't too impressed with "Insurgent." Currently, I'm in a mood for a high-octane espionage thriller featuring a secret agent.
