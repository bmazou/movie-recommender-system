I thoroughly enjoyed "Lost Horizon," "Ben-Hur," and "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button." I also liked "Kagemusha," "Air Force One," and "Star Trek: First Contact." "Logan's Run" was alright for me, but "The Day After Tomorrow" didn't quite hit the mark. Currently, I'm in a mood for a classic thriller highlighting suspense and psychological horror.
