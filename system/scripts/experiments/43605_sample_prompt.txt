I absolutely loved "Big Hero 6"! I also really enjoyed "Monsters, Inc.," "Guardians of the Galaxy," and "The Ring." "Ju-on: Black Ghost" was good for me, and "Captain America: The First Avenger" was alright. "The Lego Movie" wasn't that great for my taste, and "The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2" was just somewhat okay.
