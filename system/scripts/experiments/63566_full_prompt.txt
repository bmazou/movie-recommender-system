I really enjoyed "Monkey Business." I also liked both "Django Unchained" and "Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels." "Back to the Future Part III" was enjoyable, though not quite a favorite. "Mystic River" and "The Italian Job" are just okay for me. "The Witches of Eastwick" wasn't too great, and I didn't like "Lethal Weapon 2." Currently, I'm in a mood for a dramatic journey through historical events marked by sheer determination.
