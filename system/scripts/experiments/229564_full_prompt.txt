I absolutely loved "Kung Fu Panda 2" and "Snowpiercer." I really enjoyed "Shooter" and "Along Came a Spider," and I liked "Chappie," "Blade Runner," and "Pearl Harbor." "Resident Evil: The Final Chapter" is just okay for me. Currently, I'm in a mood for a stylish heist ensemble film centered around a casino robbery.
