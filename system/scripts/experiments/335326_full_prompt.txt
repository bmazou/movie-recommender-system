I really enjoyed "Furious 7," with "The Prestige" being close behind. I also liked "White House Down," "Schindler's List," "L.A. Confidential," and "Raiders of the Lost Ark." "Reservoir Dogs" was good too, and "Mission: Impossible III" was just okay for me. Currently, I'm in a mood for a gritty superhero origin story emphasizing fear and justice.
