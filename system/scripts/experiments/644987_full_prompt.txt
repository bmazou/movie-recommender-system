I really enjoyed watching "Jackie Brown," "Interstellar," and "The Hateful Eight." "Inglourious Basterds" and "X2: X-Men United" were also great movies for me. "Ocean's Eleven," "Some Like It Hot," and "Run Lola Run (Lola rennt)" were quite good as well. Currently, I'm in a mood for a gritty neo-noir crime drama set in the 1950s.
