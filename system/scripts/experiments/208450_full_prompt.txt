I absolutely loved "American Hustle" and "Goodfellas." I liked "Crash" quite a bit. I have mixed feelings about "Dallas Buyers Club," "Whiplash," "Sicario," and "Remember the Titans." I didn't really enjoy "Django Unchained." Currently, I'm in a mood for a thrilling apocalyptic film featuring a global zombie outbreak.
