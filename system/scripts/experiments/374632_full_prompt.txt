I absolutely loved "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" and "Monty Python and the Holy Grail." I really enjoyed "Kiki's Delivery Service," "No Country for Old Men," and "Schindler's List." I liked "Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope" and "Shaun of the Dead" quite a bit. However, I truly hated "Thor: The Dark World." Currently, I'm in a mood for a surreal dark comedy about a wild night in the city.
