I enjoyed "Men in Black," "The Pink Panther," and "Last Tango in Paris (Ultimo tango a Parigi)." I also found "Murder at the Gallop," "Viva María!," and "Murder Ahoy" to be quite good. "Love Story" and "Blue Jasmine" were okay for me. Currently, I'm in a mood for a tragic drama exploring themes of vengeance and mythology.
