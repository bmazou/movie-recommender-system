I absolutely loved "Arrival," "Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," "Babe," and "The Bourne Ultimatum." I really enjoyed "2 Fast 2 Furious," "How to Train Your Dragon 2," and "Riddick." "Stargate" was okay for me. Currently, I'm in a mood for a dark fantasy film with a tale of sibling resilience amidst misfortune.
