I really liked "Dazed and Confused" and "Mulholland Drive." I also enjoyed "Zero de conduite," "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre," "Marathon Man," and "Blazing Saddles." "Guardians of the Galaxy" was alright, and "Yes Man" wasn't too great for me. Currently, I'm in a mood for a heartfelt dramedy dealing with illness-fueled friendship.
