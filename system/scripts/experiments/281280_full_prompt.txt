I absolutely loved "Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi" and "Days of Heaven." I'm also very fond of "Paprika (Papurika)," "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom," and "Jodorowsky's Dune." "Fargo" was quite good for me, while "The Social Network" and "Independence Day" were just okay. Currently, I'm in a mood for a high-stakes espionage thriller with intense action scenes.
