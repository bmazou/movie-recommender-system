I absolutely loved "Back to the Future," "Monty Python and the Holy Grail," and "Django Unchained." Movies that I enjoyed quite a bit include "Ex Machina," "The Incredibles," and "Memento." "Independence Day" and "Fargo" were okay for me. Currently, I'm in a mood for a dark psychological thriller centered around a series of crimes.
