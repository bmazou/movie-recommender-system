I'm completely in love with "Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi" and "Forrest Gump." I really enjoyed watching "Doctor Strange" and "The Prestige." The movies "Timecrimes (Cronocrímenes, Los)," "War for the Planet of the Apes," "Man of Steel," and "Braveheart" are all quite enjoyable to me as well. Currently, I'm in a mood for a psychological thriller involving a group of trainees.
