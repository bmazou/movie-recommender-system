I think "Drive," "Schindler's List," "Pulp Fiction," and "Good Will Hunting" are all fantastic. "Zootopia" is pretty enjoyable too. "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King" and "Black Swan" are just okay for me. "Moulin Rouge" didn't quite hit the mark for me. Currently, I'm in a mood for a dark, surreal comedy exploring societal norms and relationships.
