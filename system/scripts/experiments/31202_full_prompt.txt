I absolutely love "Burnt by the Sun" and I really enjoyed "Touch of Evil," "Europa Europa," and "City Island." "M*A*S*H," "The Breakfast Club," and "Cast Away" are pretty good. "Batman Forever" wasn't too great for me. Currently, I'm in a mood for a groundbreaking adventure film featuring prehistoric creatures.
