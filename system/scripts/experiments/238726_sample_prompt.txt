I absolutely loved "The Usual Suspects" and really enjoyed both "La La Land" and "Birdman: Or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)." "Swordfish," "The Jewel of the Nile," and "The Faculty" were enjoyable as well. I'm not too keen on "Urban Legends: Final Cut," and "Crocodile Dundee II" was just okay for me.
