I really loved "Birdman: Or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly," and "Good Will Hunting." I also enjoyed "Interstellar," "Titanic," and "Vanilla Sky." "Kill Bill: Vol. 1" and "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl" are okay for me. Currently, I'm in a mood for a post-apocalyptic action film with intense car chases.
