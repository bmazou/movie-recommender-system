I absolutely loved "Pulp Fiction," "Snatch," "The Prestige," "Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels," and "Mad Max: Fury Road." I really enjoyed "Memento." "Django Unchained" was alright for me, and "Reservoir Dogs" didn't quite do it for me.
 Currently, I'm in a mood for a gritty reboot of a vigilante's origin story.
