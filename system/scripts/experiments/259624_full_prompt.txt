I absolutely loved "Dallas Buyers Club," "The Wolf of Wall Street," and "American Sniper." "Starsky & Hutch" and "Serendipity" are okay for me. I didn't enjoy "Black Swan" that much, and I really hated both "The Matrix" and "I, Robot." Currently, I'm in a mood for a romantic drama exploring mental health and healing.
