I really enjoyed "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" and "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King." "Juno" and "Underworld: Rise of the Lycans" are quite enjoyable too. "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," "Napoleon Dynamite," and "13 Going on 30" are okay for me. I didn't find "Sleepless in Seattle" particularly great. Currently, I'm in a mood for an action-packed cybernetic sequel exploring reality and control.
