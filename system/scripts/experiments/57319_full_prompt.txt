I really enjoyed "Big Hero 6," "The World Is Not Enough," "Space Cowboys," "The Gods Must Be Crazy," and "Waking Ned Devine." "Iron Man 2" was okay for me, "Good Burger" didn't quite hit the mark, and I really dislike "Wild Wild West." Currently, I'm in a mood for a thrilling spy action film centered on amnesia.
