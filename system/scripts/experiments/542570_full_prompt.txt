I absolutely loved "Full Metal Jacket" and "Pulp Fiction." I really enjoyed "Edge of Tomorrow," "A Clockwork Orange," "Saving Private Ryan," and "Reservoir Dogs." "Slumdog Millionaire" and "Braveheart" were good too, but I didn't enjoy them as much as the others. Currently, I'm in a mood for a science fiction epic exploring space travel and love.
