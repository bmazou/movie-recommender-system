I had a blast with "Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi" and "Psycho." "Halloween" is great in my book, and I thoroughly enjoyed "Ratatouille," "Freaks," and "Mean Girls." "Ghostbusters" is quite good for me, whereas "How the Grinch Stole Christmas!" is just alright. Currently, I'm in a mood for a fantasy adventure exploring dark secrets and teenage turmoil.
