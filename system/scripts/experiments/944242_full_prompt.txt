I absolutely loved "Mars Attacks!," "Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," "Raiders of the Lost Ark," "L.A. Confidential," "Breakdown," and "The Dark Knight." I also enjoyed "Drag Me to Hell." "Chicken Run" is just okay for me. Currently, I'm in a mood for a survival story set on Mars with a focus on ingenuity and perseverance.
