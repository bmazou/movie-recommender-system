I absolutely loved "Inside Out" and "Megamind." I really enjoyed "The Boy in the Striped Pajamas" and "The Hunger Games." "The Godfather: Part II" and "American Beauty" were good for me. "The Wizard of Oz" and "Jurassic Park" were okay for me. Currently, I'm in a mood for a historical drama centered on codebreaking and wartime efforts.
