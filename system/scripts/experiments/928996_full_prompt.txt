I adored "Cinema Paradiso (Nuovo cinema Paradiso)" and I'm very fond of "Show Me Love (Fucking Åmål)." Both "Ivan's Childhood" and "Notting Hill" were quite enjoyable. "Frost/Nixon" and "Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood" were good. "The Transporter" was alright, but I really didn't like "Police Academy: Mission to Moscow." Currently, I'm in a mood for a psychological thriller exploring alternate realities.
