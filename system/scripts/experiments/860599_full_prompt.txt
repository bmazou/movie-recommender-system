I absolutely loved "Invasion of the Body Snatchers." "Elementary Particles" and "Wallace & Gromit: The Wrong Trousers" are also among my favorites. I really enjoyed "Andalusian Dog, An." "Roger & Me," "Blind Side, The," and "Pretty Woman" are quite enjoyable for me too. "Colors" was okay for me. Currently, I'm in a mood for a road trip film exploring female empowerment and friendship.
