I despise "Rear Window," and I wasn't impressed with either "Shrek the Third" or "The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian." "The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie" was alright, but I thoroughly enjoyed "Layer Cake" and "Timecrimes (Cronocrímenes, Los)." "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1" is quite good in my view, but "Braveheart" is one of my absolute favorites. Currently, I'm in a mood for a noir-inspired science fiction mystery involving memory manipulation.
