I think "The Sting" and "The Killing Fields" are great films. I feel positively about "We Are Marshall" and "Men in Black." Movies like "Sicario," "Mighty Aphrodite," and "The Bourne Ultimatum" are okay to me. However, "The Terminator" didn't impress me much. Currently, I'm in a mood for a biographical drama centered on a controversial publisher and freedom of speech.
