I truly love "2001: A Space Odyssey" and "Reconstruction," I also have a lot of affection for "Down by Law," "In the Mood For Love," and "Gattaca." "Monsters, Inc." is really enjoyable for me, while "Dallas Buyers Club" is just okay. However, I don't like "Mission: Impossible." Currently, I'm in a mood for a gritty drama exploring addiction and friendship.
