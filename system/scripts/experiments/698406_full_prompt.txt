I enjoyed "Drifting Clouds (Kauas pilvet karkaavat)" and "Terminator 2: Judgment Day" a lot, and I liked both "Vizontele" and "Jacob's Ladder." "Mariachi, El," "Monty Python's The Meaning of Life," and "Miami Vice" were pretty good. "Secret Obsession" wasn't too impressive for me. Currently, I'm in a mood for a psychological drama exploring familial tension and tragedy.
