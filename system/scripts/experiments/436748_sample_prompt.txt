I absolutely loved "Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," "Shanghai Knights," and "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End." I really enjoyed both "Iron Man" and "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull." "Ocean's Twelve" and "Rango" were okay for me. "The Simpsons Movie" wasn't too great for me.
