I really loved "Mean Girls" and thoroughly enjoyed "Aliens" and "A Clockwork Orange." "Train to Busan" was pretty good, and "Starship Troopers" and "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl" were enjoyable enough. "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (Wo hu cang long)" didn't quite captivate me, and I didn't really like "Star Trek Into Darkness." Currently, I'm in a mood for a drama centered on untapped genius and personal growth.
