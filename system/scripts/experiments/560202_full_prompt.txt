I absolutely love "When a Man Loves a Woman" and have strong affection for "Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope." I really enjoy "Flipper," "Primal Fear," and "The Matrix." "Dracula: Dead and Loving It," "High School High," and "Celtic Pride" are just okay for me. Currently, I'm in a mood for an action-packed thriller set on an island prison.
