I adore "Deadpool 2" and really enjoyed "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" and "Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them." "Shaun of the Dead" and "Inception" are okay for me. However, I do not like "Back to the Future" and I really dislike both "Shrek" and "Inside Out." Currently, I'm in a mood for a colorful superhero adventure infused with humor and mythology.
