I thoroughly enjoyed "Spring," "Boyhood," "There's Something About Mary," and "Kung Fury." "American History X" was pretty good for me, whereas "The Road" was just okay. "The Babadook" didn't impress me much, and "Terminator Salvation" I didn't like very much. Currently, I'm in a mood for a horror-comedy film with a time-loop twist.
