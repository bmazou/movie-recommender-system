I enjoyed "V for Vendetta," "Kick-Ass," and "The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers." "National Treasure: Book of Secrets," "National Treasure," and "Shrek 2" were also enjoyable for me. "Spider-Man 3" was okay, but I didn't really like "Howl's Moving Castle (Hauru no ugoku shiro)." Currently, I'm in a mood for a quirky, visually-stunning comedy with a whimsical narrative.
