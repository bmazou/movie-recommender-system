I absolutely love "Spirited Away," "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," "Inception," "The Hurt Locker," and "Training Day." I also really enjoy both "X2: X-Men United" and "District 9," while "The Town" is just okay for me. Currently, I'm in a mood for a young adult dystopian adventure involving tests and survival.
