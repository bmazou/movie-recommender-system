I absolutely loved "The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers." I enjoyed "Inglourious Basterds" and "The Devil's Advocate." "The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," "Forrest Gump," and "Wallace & Gromit: The Best of Aardman Animation" were good. "Inside Llewyn Davis" was okay for me, but I didn't really like "Twelve Monkeys."
