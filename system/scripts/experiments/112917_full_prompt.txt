I truly love "Prometheus," "Interstellar," and "Gone Girl." I also really enjoyed movies like "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," "Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," "Guardians of the Galaxy," "X-Men: The Last Stand," and "Fight Club." Currently, I'm in a mood for a magical fantasy film centered around dark secrets and school life.
