I absolutely love "Doctor Strange" and "Edge of Tomorrow." I really enjoyed "The Mechanic," "Django Unchained," and "The Accountant." "Schindler's List" and "The Italian Job" are movies I also like very much. "22 Jump Street" is just okay for me. Currently, I'm in a mood for a gritty superhero drama with emotional depth.
