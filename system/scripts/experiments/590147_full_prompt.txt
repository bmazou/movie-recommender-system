I really loved "The Pursuit of Happyness" and I enjoyed "Seven Pounds." Both "The Perfect Storm" and "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial" were pretty good. "The Truman Show" was just okay for me. I'm not very fond of "The Royal Tenenbaums," and "Hitman" was alright. I really hated "Insidious." Currently, I'm in a mood for a gritty superhero film centered on redemption and resilience.
