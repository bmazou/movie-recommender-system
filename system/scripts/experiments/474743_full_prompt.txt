I absolutely loved both "Dawn of the Dead" and "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone." I really enjoyed "50/50" and "(500) Days of Summer" as well. "Hannah and Her Sisters" and "Life of Pi" were pretty good, though not my favorites. "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest" didn't impress me much, and I absolutely hated "Hugo." Currently, I'm in a mood for an animated comedy involving creatures and childlike wonder.
