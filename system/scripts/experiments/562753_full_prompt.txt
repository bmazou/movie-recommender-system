I really enjoyed "Jaws" a lot. I also liked "The Matrix," "Clerks," and "The Fugitive." "The Dark Knight," "The Lost World: Jurassic Park," and "Monty Python and the Holy Grail" were nice as well. "The Blair Witch Project" didn't quite impress me, though. Currently, I'm in a mood for a political thriller exploring themes of rebellion and freedom.
