I absolutely loved both "In Time" and "Back to the Future Part III." "Hotel Rwanda" and "Road to Perdition" were fantastic. I enjoyed "Kung Fu Panda 2," "The Shawshank Redemption," and "Godzilla." "Shallow Hal" was just okay for me. Currently, I'm in a mood for a gritty superhero crime thriller with intense moral dilemmas.
