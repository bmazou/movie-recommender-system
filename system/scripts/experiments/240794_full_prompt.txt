I thought "Final Destination" and "Source Code" were quite enjoyable. "He's a Dragon," "Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," and "Pawn Sacrifice" are decent for me. I didn't find much to like about "Battle for Haditha" and "The Post," and I didn't enjoy "Geostorm" much at all. Currently, I'm in a mood for a legal thriller set in China, highlighting cultural and legal clashes.
