I absolutely loved "Groundhog Day," "Watchmen," and "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button." I enjoyed "Iron Man 2." "Kill Bill: Vol. 1" and "Mortal Kombat" were okay for me. "Pocahontas" wasn't too great for me, but I really didn't like "Avengers: Age of Ultron." Currently, I'm in a mood for an epic saga of family and romance in the early 20th century.
