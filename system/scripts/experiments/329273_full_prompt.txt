I genuinely enjoyed "Ghostbusters," "Caddyshack," and "Secretary." "Inception" was fantastic, almost perfect for me. I found "The Game" and "Dragonheart" to be quite good as well. However, "Das Experiment" and "Cry-Baby" didn't leave much of an impression on me. Currently, I'm in a mood for an animated ocean adventure centered on family and friendship.
