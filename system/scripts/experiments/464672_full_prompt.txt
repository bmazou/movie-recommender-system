I absolutely loved "Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," "Schindler's List," "Forrest Gump," "Goodfellas," and "The Matrix." I also really enjoyed "Training Day," "Prisoners," and "Requiem for a Dream." Currently, I'm in a mood for a thrilling adventure with prehistoric creatures brought to life.
