I absolutely loved "Schindler's List." Some other movies I really enjoyed include "Event Horizon," "Evil Dead II (Dead by Dawn)," "Rumble in the Bronx (Hont faan kui)," and "Terminator 2: Judgment Day." "Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl" was also quite enjoyable for me. "Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot" was okay, but I wasn't very fond of "The Cable Guy."
