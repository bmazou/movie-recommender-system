I really enjoyed both "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood" and "Back to the Future." "High Fidelity" was quite good in my opinion. However, I really didn't like "The Day After Tomorrow," "2012," "Gran Torino," "It," and "The Avengers." Currently, I'm in a mood for a crime drama about ambition and downfall.
