I am absolutely in love with "Breathless" and "Fight Club." Some other movies I really like are "Home Fries," "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," and "Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi." "Prizzi's Honor" is okay for me, but I don't really enjoy either "Selena" or "The Wedding Singer." Currently, I'm in a mood for a legal thriller centered around corporate corruption.
