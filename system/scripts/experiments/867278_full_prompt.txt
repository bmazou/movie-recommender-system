I absolutely loved "The Haunted Mansion," "Mulan," "Maleficent," "We Bought a Zoo," "Enchanted," and "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory." I really enjoyed "Beverly Hills Chihuahua 3" and "Home Alone 2: Lost in New York" as well. Currently, I'm in a mood for a holiday comedy filled with clever pranks.
