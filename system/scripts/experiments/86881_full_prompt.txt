I absolutely loved "Life Is Beautiful (La Vita è bella)," "Rain Man," "Pulp Fiction," and "Fight Club." I also really enjoyed "Schindler's List" and "Jumanji." "Ted" and "The Hangover Part II" were very enjoyable for me as well. Currently, I'm in a mood for an animated comedy featuring zoo animals on an adventure.
