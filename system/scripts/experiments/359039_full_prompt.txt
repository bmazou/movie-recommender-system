I absolutely loved "All About My Mother (Todo sobre mi madre)," and I enjoyed "Submarine," "The Illusionist," and "Trainspotting." Movies I found pretty good include "As Good as It Gets" and "Kingsman: The Secret Service". "The Pursuit of Happyness" is okay for me, but "The Princess Diaries" wasn't too great for me. Currently, I'm in a mood for a poignant drama centered around a quest for reconciliation.
