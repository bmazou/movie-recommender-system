I absolutely love "Inglourious Basterds," "Coco," "Gone Girl," "Howl's Moving Castle," "Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," and "Dead Poets Society." I’m really fond of the "Untitled Spider-Man Reboot" and I also like "Logan." Currently, I'm in a mood for an animated adventure exploring friendship and loss.
