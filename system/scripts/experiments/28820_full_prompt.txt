I absolutely loved "Cinderella," "The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," "Kick-Ass," and "Neighbors." I also really liked "The Notebook" and "Snow White and the Huntsman". "The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel" was just okay for me, but I really didn't enjoy "Scary Movie 2." Currently, I'm in a mood for an animated film about environmental themes and artificial intelligence.
