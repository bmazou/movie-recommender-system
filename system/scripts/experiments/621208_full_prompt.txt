I'm really fond of "Leaving Las Vegas," "Arrival," "Birdman: Or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," and "The Handmaiden." I also like "La La Land" and "The Big Sick." "Hidden Figures" is pretty good, while "Inception" is just okay for me. Currently, I'm in a mood for a sci-fi film exploring social segregation and xenophobia.
