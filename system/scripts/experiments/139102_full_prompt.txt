I enjoyed "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" and "Trainspotting." I absolutely loved "True Lies" and "Apollo 13." Movies like "Cliffhanger," "Dances with Wolves," "Die Hard: With a Vengeance," and "Outbreak" are just okay for me. Currently, I'm in a mood for a comedy centered around an eccentric animal investigator.
