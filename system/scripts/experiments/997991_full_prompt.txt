I couldn't stand "Batman & Robin" and I really don't like "Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls." I think "Good Will Hunting" and "Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi" are okay. "Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol" is quite enjoyable. I really enjoyed "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" and "Manchester by the Sea." I absolutely love "Memento." Currently, I'm in a mood for an animated film featuring a friendship with a colossal robot.
