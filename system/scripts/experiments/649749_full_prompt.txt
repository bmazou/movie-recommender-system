I absolutely loved "Spirited Away," "Good Will Hunting," "The Godfather," "Slumdog Millionaire," and "The Young Victoria." I really enjoyed "The Holiday" but "Chocolat" was just pretty good. "The Prestige" didn't really impress me much. Currently, I'm in a mood for a drama centered on a heartfelt journey of discovery.
