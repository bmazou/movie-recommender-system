I absolutely loved "Tag" and "The Godfather." "Blade Runner 2049" was fantastic for me. I also really enjoyed "Die Hard 2," "The Pursuit of Happyness," "Shutter Island," and "Star Trek: The Motion Picture." "Colossal" is okay for me. Currently, I'm in a mood for a crime drama set during Prohibition, focusing on law enforcement.
