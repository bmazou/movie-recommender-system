I quite enjoyed "Léon: The Professional," "The Men Who Stare at Goats," "The Libertine," "Harold and Maude," and "Pan's Labyrinth." I liked "Black Swan" and "Peaceful Warrior," while "Orgazmo" was just okay for me. Currently, I'm in a mood for a black-and-white indie comedy centered on retail workers.
