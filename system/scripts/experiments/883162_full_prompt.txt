I absolutely loved "The Godfather," "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," and "The Shawshank Redemption." I have a lot of affection for "Moon," "American History X," and "X-Men: First Class." I also really enjoyed "Braveheart." Currently, I'm in a mood for an origin story of a tech-savvy billionaire turning hero.
