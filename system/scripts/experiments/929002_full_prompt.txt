I absolutely adore "Something's Gotta Give," "Some Folks Call It a Sling Blade," and "The Little Rascals." I also have a lot of love for "Aliens," "How to Train Your Dragon," "Inside Out," and "Breakfast at Tiffany's." "Dawn of the Dead" was just okay for me. Currently, I'm in a mood for an animated adventure about loyalty and growing up.
