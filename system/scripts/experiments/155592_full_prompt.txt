I absolutely loved "Office Christmas Party," "The Matrix," "Fantasia," "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," "The Maltese Falcon," and "The Great Wall." I really enjoyed "The Hunchback of Notre Dame." "Last Action Hero" wasn't particularly impressive to me. Currently, I'm in a mood for an animated comedy featuring lovable minions and quirky family dynamics.
