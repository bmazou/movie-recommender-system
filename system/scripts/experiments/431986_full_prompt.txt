I absolutely loved "Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope" and really enjoyed "Conan the Barbarian" and "Iron Man". "King Kong," "Con Air," "Hulk," and "The X-Files: Fight the Future" were just okay for me. "Hang 'Em High" didn't leave much of an impression. Currently, I'm in a mood for a psychological thriller centered on obsession and acrophobia.
