I absolutely loved "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe," "Love Actually," "Sixteen Candles," and "The Little Rascals." I also really enjoyed "Three Men in a Boat" and "The Bourne Ultimatum." As for "Twilight" and "How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," they're just okay for me. Currently, I'm in a mood for a spy thriller featuring high-stakes poker.
