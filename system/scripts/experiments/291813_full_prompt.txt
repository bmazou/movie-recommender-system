I enjoyed "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," "Cloud Atlas," "Tuesdays with Morrie," and "Seven." "Mission: Impossible" and "Transcendence" were pretty good for me. "The Place Beyond the Pines" and "Triple Frontier" were okay. Currently, I'm in a mood for an inspirational drama about overcoming adversity.
