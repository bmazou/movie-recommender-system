I really loved "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" and "The Hunger Games." I enjoyed "Harold and Maude" and "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1." "Men in Black" is pretty good for me. "Interstellar" is just okay, while "Love and Death" and "Juno" didn't impress me much. Currently, I'm in a mood for a historical epic centered around an ancient revolt.
