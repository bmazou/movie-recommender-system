I really like "The Secret of NIMH". "Exam", "The Raid: Redemption", and "What's Eating Gilbert Grape" were enjoyable. I didn't particularly enjoy "Scary Movie 3" and "Scary Movie 4". I really don't like "The Brothers Grimm" and "Jurassic Park III". Currently, I'm in a mood for a dark comedy featuring an eccentric, spooky family.
