I truly enjoyed "Iron Man" and "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban." "Lady and the Tramp" was quite nice, while both "The Nightmare Before Christmas" and "The Secret of Kells" were just okay for me. I really didn't like "Ant-Man," "Khumba," and I absolutely hated "Gumby: The Movie." Currently, I'm in a mood for an animated comedy about an unusual workplace.
