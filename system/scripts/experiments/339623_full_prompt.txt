I absolutely loved "The Handmaiden," "Avatar," "Spirited Away (Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi)," and "El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie." I really enjoyed "The Prince of Egypt" and "Tarzan." "WALL·E" and "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" are okay for me. Currently, I'm in a mood for a magical journey of a young wizard discovering his heritage.
