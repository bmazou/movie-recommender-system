I really enjoyed "Terminator 2: Judgment Day" and found "Gangs of New York" to be quite good. "Despicable Me" is okay for me, and I don't mind watching "He's Just Not That Into You." "Big Daddy" and "Raiders of the Lost Ark" don't impress me much. I really dislike both "Just Go with It" and "The Hangover". Currently, I'm in a mood for a romantic comedy highlighting an unconventional love story.
