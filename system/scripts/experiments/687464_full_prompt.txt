I really loved "Animal House" and enjoyed both "The Avengers," and "Batman Begins." "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl" and "Justice League: Doom" were also enjoyable. "Batman Forever" and "Copycat" were just okay for me, but "Toy Story 2" wasn't too great. Currently, I'm in a mood for a comedy sequel about elderly rivals and romance.
