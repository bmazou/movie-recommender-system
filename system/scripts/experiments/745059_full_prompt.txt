I enjoyed watching "Spy," "Planet Terror," and "Maleficent." "The Butterfly Effect" and "Tropic Thunder" are both good as well. "Get Him to the Greek" and "Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted" are okay for me. However, I really didn't like "Echelon Conspiracy." Currently, I'm in a mood for an animated adventure involving robotics and friendship.
