I really enjoyed "The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," "Stranger than Fiction," "Howl's Moving Castle," and "The King's Speech." "Minority Report" is quite good too. "The Avengers" and "X-Men" are just okay for me. "Ghost World" wasn't very impressive to me. Currently, I'm in a mood for a historical drama addressing genocide and humanitarian crisis.
