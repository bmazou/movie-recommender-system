I thought "Spirited Away (Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi)" was amazing. I also enjoyed "The Shining," "Eyes Wide Shut," "Scarface," and "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix." "Spy" and "Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace" were just okay for me, while I didn't really care for "Battlefield Earth."
