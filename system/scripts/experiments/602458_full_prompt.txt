I absolutely loved "The Cook the Thief His Wife & Her Lover" and "Scarface." I found "Man with the Movie Camera" and "Animal Kingdom" to be fascinating. I enjoyed watching "Heat," "Take Shelter," and "Ed Wood." "13 Tzameti" was also something I really liked. Currently, I'm in a mood for a suspenseful revenge thriller with a focus on realism.
