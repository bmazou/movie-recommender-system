I absolutely loved "Die Hard." I thought "Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa" was fantastic. I really enjoyed "A View to a Kill," "Diamonds Are Forever," "The Grey," and "You Don't Mess with the Zohan." I found "Donald Trump's The Art of the Deal: The Movie" to be pretty enjoyable as well. "The Expendables 2" was just okay for me. Currently, I'm in a mood for a groundbreaking space opera featuring an epic galactic conflict.
