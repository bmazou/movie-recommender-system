I absolutely loved "The Spanish Apartment (L'auberge espagnole)" and "Copenhagen." I really enjoyed "Snatch," "2 Days in New York," and "City of God (Cidade de Deus)." "My Neighbor Totoro (Tonari no Totoro)," "Good Will Hunting," and "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest" were enjoyable for me. Currently, I'm in a mood for a heartfelt drama about an extraordinary life journey.
