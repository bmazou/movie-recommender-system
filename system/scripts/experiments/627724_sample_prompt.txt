I really enjoyed both "The Imitation Game" and "Cast Away." I also liked "Braveheart." "A Few Good Men" was fairly good and "Erin Brockovich" was okay. I didn't like "Interstellar" very much, and I really didn't like "Django Unchained." I disliked "Amelie (Fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain, Le)" quite a bit.
