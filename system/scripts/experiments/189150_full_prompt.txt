I absolutely love "The Shawshank Redemption." I really enjoyed "The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers" and "The Illusionist." I also liked "Downfall," "The Bourne Identity," and "American Gangster." "A Beautiful Mind" was quite good, but "300" was just okay for me. Currently, I'm in a mood for a courtroom drama centered around jury deliberations.
