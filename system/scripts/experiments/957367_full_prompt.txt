I am absolutely fond of "Arrival" and I really liked "Snatch." I also enjoyed "Oblivion" and "A League of Their Own." I think "Die Hard" and "Memento" are quite good too. "Entrapment" is just okay for me, but I didn't find "La La Land" very appealing. Currently, I'm in a mood for a swashbuckling adventure with supernatural elements.
