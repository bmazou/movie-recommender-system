I really enjoyed "The Others." I also liked "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull," "The Butterfly Effect," "The Sound of Music," "The Prestige," and "Shutter Island." "Sin City" was quite good, and "Blow" was okay for me. Currently, I'm in a mood for a sci-fi thriller exploring themes of cloning and freedom.
