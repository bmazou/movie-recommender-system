I enjoyed "Celebration, The (Festen)" quite a lot and "Howl's Moving Castle (Hauru no ugoku shiro)" as well. "In the Line of Fire" and "Moon" are fairly enjoyable too. "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" and "The Madness of King George" were okay for me. "Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation" wasn't too impressive, and I really hated "The Flintstones."

 Currently, I'm in a mood for a dramatic comedy exploring complex familial relationships.
