I absolutely loved "Once Upon a Time in the West," "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," and "WALL·E." I really enjoyed "Modern Times" and "Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb." "Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind" and "Monty Python and the Holy Grail" were quite good for me. "Alien" was okay for me. Currently, I'm in a mood for a gritty superhero film exploring chaos and morality.
