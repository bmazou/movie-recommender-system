I absolutely love "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince." I really enjoyed "10 Things I Hate About You," "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," "The Notebook," and "The Holiday." "The Princess Diaries" is quite enjoyable for me too, and I find "Up" to be decent. However, I didn't really like "Monsters, Inc."
