I absolutely loved "The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!", "Shrek," and "Wrongfully Accused." I also really enjoyed "GoldenEye," "Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," and "Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope." "Waterworld" was pretty good, but "Crimson Rivers 2: Angels of the Apocalypse" didn't do much for me. Currently, I'm in a mood for a comedic time-loop film exploring personal growth.
