I absolutely loved "The Matrix." I really enjoyed "Star Trek," "Ex Machina," "Terminator 2: Judgment Day," and "Surrogates." "The Terminator" and "The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian" were pretty good too. However, I did not like "The Godfather." Currently, I'm in a mood for a seminal space opera filled with adventure and iconic heroes.
