I absolutely loved "Aliens," "Love Actually," and "The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug." I really enjoyed "Slumdog Millionaire" quite a bit. I liked "The Princess Bride," "The Birdcage," and "The Truman Show." "Braveheart" was okay for me. Currently, I'm in a mood for a drama depicting the rise of a major social media platform.
