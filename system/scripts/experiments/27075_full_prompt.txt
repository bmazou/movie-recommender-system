I truly love "The Spectacular Now," "Whiplash," and "The Princess Bride." "Seven," "Dallas Buyers Club," "Watchmen," and "The Dark Knight Rises" are also movies I really enjoy. "Source Code" is another film I really like. Currently, I'm in a mood for a space western film with a focus on a crew's adventure.
