I absolutely loved "Coco" and "The Sixth Sense." "Fight Club," "Dead Poets Society," and "Catch Me If You Can" were fantastic as well. I really enjoyed "Intouchables." "The Others" was okay for me, but I really hated "Gifted." Currently, I'm in a mood for a romantic comedy with memorable mishaps and humor.
