I absolutely loved "The Matrix," and I really enjoyed "Gravity," "Guardians of the Galaxy 2," and "Slumdog Millionaire." "Mad Max: Fury Road" was quite enjoyable, while I found "The Imitation Game" to be okay. "The Wolf of Wall Street" didn't impress me much, and I didn't like "Terminator 2: Judgment Day" that much.
