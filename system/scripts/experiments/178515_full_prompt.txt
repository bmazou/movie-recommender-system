I absolutely loved "Mrs. Doubtfire," "Pocahontas," and "Tarzan." Some other films I really enjoyed are "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," "Cheaper by the Dozen," and "Treasure Planet." "Kung Fu Panda" and "Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back" were also great. Currently, I'm in a mood for an animated adventure comedy with zoo animals exploring the wild.
