I absolutely loved both "The Dark Knight Rises" and "Dredd." I really enjoyed "The Big Lebowski" and "Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind." "Looper" was quite enjoyable for me too. "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," "The Book of Eli," and "A.I. Artificial Intelligence" were all good but not outstanding.
