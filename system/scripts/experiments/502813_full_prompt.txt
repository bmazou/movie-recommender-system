I absolutely loved "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," "Tropic Thunder," "Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," "Deadpool 2," and "Thor: Ragnarok." "Hot Fuzz" is something I really enjoyed as well. "Gran Torino" and "Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi" are movies I liked quite a bit. Currently, I'm in a mood for a cyberpunk action film exploring simulated reality.
