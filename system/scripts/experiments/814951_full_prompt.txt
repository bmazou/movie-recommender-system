I absolutely loved "Neighbors," "Kingsman: The Secret Service," and "Memento." I really enjoyed "Dallas Buyers Club," "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," "Now You See Me," and "Moneyball." "Birdman: Or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)" was also quite impressive to me. Currently, I'm in a mood for a survival science fiction film set on Mars.
