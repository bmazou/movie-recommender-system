I absolutely loved "Reservoir Dogs," "2001: A Space Odyssey," "Seven Samurai (Shichinin no samurai)," and "Whiplash." I really enjoyed "Schindler's List," "Kill Bill: Vol. 2," and "Birdman: Or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)." "The Matrix" was quite good for me as well. Currently, I'm in a mood for a crime thriller with an iconic plot twist.
