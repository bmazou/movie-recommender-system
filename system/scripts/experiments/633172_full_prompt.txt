I really enjoyed both "Your Friends and Neighbors" and "The Assassination of Richard Nixon." "Guardians of the Galaxy" was quite fun for me. Movies like "Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," "Inside Out," "Top Gun," and "Punch-Drunk Love" were okay. However, I wasn't a fan of "Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World." Currently, I'm in a mood for a psychological thriller with a supernatural twist.
