I really loved "Frequency" and "Room." I also enjoyed "Schindler's List" and "Meet the Parents." I liked "October Sky," while I thought "Platoon" and "The Blair Witch Project" were okay. However, "Hot Shots! Part Deux" wasn't great for me. Currently, I'm in a mood for a historical drama centered on a powerful queen’s rise to power.
