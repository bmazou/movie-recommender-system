I absolutely love "Fight Club," "Casablanca," "Schindler's List," "The Silence of the Lambs," and "Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope." I also really enjoyed "Apollo 13" and "Blade Runner." "A Bug's Life" is a movie I liked very much as well. Currently, I'm in a mood for a romantic comedy exploring friendship and love over the years.
