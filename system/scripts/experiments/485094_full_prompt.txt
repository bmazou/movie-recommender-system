I absolutely loved both "The Negotiator" and "Spider-Man." I enjoyed "I Am Sam," and "Salmon Fishing in the Yemen" was pretty good. "The Scorpion King," "Walk the Line," and "The Last Five Years" are okay. However, I didn't really like "The Twilight Saga: Eclipse." Currently, I'm in a mood for a disaster film centered on an astronomical threat.
