I absolutely loved "Star Trek" and "Taken." "Doctor Strange," "Mission: Impossible III," and "Serendipity" are movies I really enjoy as well. "Law Abiding Citizen" is also something I like quite a bit. "Hannibal" is decent for me, whereas "Independence Day" is just okay. Currently, I'm in a mood for a tense urban crime thriller with a time-sensitive mission.
