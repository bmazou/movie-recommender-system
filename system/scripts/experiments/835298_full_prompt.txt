I absolutely loved "O Brother, Where Art Thou?," "Key Largo," "Avatar," "Singin' in the Rain," and "Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi." "The Asphalt Jungle" was quite enjoyable too. "Inception" was just okay for me, while "The Apartment" didn't really do it for me. Currently, I'm in a mood for a satirical black comedy about nuclear war.
