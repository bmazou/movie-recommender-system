"The Pink Panther 2" and "Maleficent" are movies I absolutely loved. I really enjoyed "Twister" and found "Lara Croft: Tomb Raider" quite enjoyable too. "Ella Enchanted," "Myth, The (San wa)," and "Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance" are just okay for me. I didn't enjoy "The Exorcist" much. Currently, I'm in a mood for a swashbuckling adventure featuring a masked vigilante.
