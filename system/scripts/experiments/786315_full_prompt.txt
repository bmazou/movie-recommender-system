I absolutely loved both "The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers" and "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring." I also really enjoyed "Ice Age" and found "xXx" to be quite enjoyable as well. "The 13th Warrior" didn't really appeal to me, and I really hated "Coyote Ugly," "City of God (Cidade de Deus)," and "Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope." Currently, I'm in a mood for a sci-fi comedy sequel involving extraterrestrial regulation.
