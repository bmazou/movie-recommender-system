I absolutely loved "Raiders of the Lost Ark" and "Mulholland Drive." I really enjoyed "Life of Pi," "Downfall," and "The Remains of the Day." "Garden State" and "Cake" were okay for me. However, "GoldenEye" wasn't too great. Currently, I'm in a mood for a psychological thriller involving memory and revenge.
