I absolutely hated "Underworld: Evolution," "GoldenEye," and "Star Trek: First Contact." "Minions" didn't sit well with me either. "Gran Torino" was slightly better, but still not really my thing. "Braveheart" was quite good, and "Liar Liar" and "Maverick" are okay in my book. Currently, I'm in a mood for a British crime comedy with intertwining storylines.
