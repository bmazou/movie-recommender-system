I absolutely loved "Gabbar Is Back," "Iron Man," "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," "The Shawshank Redemption," and "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales." I really enjoyed "The Martian" as well. "Avatar" and "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl" were decent for me. Currently, I'm in a mood for a crime thriller featuring a masked vigilante.
