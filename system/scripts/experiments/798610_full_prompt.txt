I absolutely loved "Terminator 2: Judgment Day," "Ex Machina," "The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," and "Fight Club." I really enjoyed "Moon" and "Up." "Interstellar" and "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" are okay for me. Currently, I'm in a mood for a gripping sci-fi action film featuring time loops.
