I absolutely loved "The Lion King" and "WALL·E." I also really enjoyed "Changeling" and "Central Station (Central do Brasil)." "Crimson Tide," "The Legend of 1900," and "Madagascar" were quite enjoyable for me as well. "Independence Day" is okay for me. Currently, I'm in a mood for an adventurous action film with ancient curses.
