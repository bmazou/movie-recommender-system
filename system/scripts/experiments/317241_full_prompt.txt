I thoroughly enjoyed "The Polar Express" and quite liked "Edge of Tomorrow," "The Terminator," "Dawn of the Dead," and "Land of the Dead." I found both "Shooter" and "Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World" to be quite good. "Lucy" was pretty decent for me. Currently, I'm in a mood for a heartfelt sci-fi tale about friendship and discovery.
