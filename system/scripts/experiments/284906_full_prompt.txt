I enjoyed "Inception" quite a bit and liked "Unforgiven". "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels", "The Godfather: Part II", "The Sting", and "The Godfather" are okay for me. I really didn't like "The Hangover" and "Goodfellas". Currently, I'm in a mood for a suspenseful psychological thriller with continuous scene takes.
