I loved both "The Lion King" and "Doctor Strange." I really enjoyed "Back to the Future Part II," "The Terminator," and "Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them." "The Bourne Supremacy" and "Transformers: Age of Extinction" were pretty good for me as well. However, I didn't enjoy "John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum" much.
