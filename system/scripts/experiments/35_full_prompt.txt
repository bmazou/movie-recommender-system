I absolutely loved "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," "Juno," "Moana," "Léon: The Professional," "Lady Bird," and "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King." "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" is okay for me, while "In Time" wasn't too great. Currently, I'm in a mood for a teen drama about high school detention dynamics.
