I enjoyed "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly," "Chappie," and "Top Gun." "Twilight," "The Martian," and "Diabolique" are okay for me. "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" wasn't too great, and I didn't particularly like "George of the Jungle." Currently, I'm in a mood for a heartwarming comedy about family and disguise.
