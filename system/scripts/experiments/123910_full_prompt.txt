I really love "The Breakfast Club" and I also enjoyed "The Purple Rose of Cairo" and "The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp." "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest" and "Videodrome" were quite enjoyable too. "Island of Lost Souls" and "The Babadook" are okay for me, but "Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows" wasn't too great for my taste. Currently, I'm in a mood for a classic comedy featuring a troupe of zany antics.
