I really liked both "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix" and "A Beautiful Mind." I also enjoyed "Easy A," "The Social Network," and "Spotlight." I think "Gifted" and "The Departed" were pretty good too. "The Sound of Music" is okay for me. Currently, I'm in a mood for a World War II alternate history film with intense dialogues.
