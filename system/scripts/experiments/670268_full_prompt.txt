I absolutely loved "City of God (Cidade de Deus)" and really enjoyed both "Ladder 49" and "Snowden." "Nuremberg" was quite good for me. "Midnight in Paris" and "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story" were just alright. I didn't much care for "The Exorcist" or "George of the Jungle 2." Currently, I'm in a mood for a heist thriller featuring elaborate illusions and magic.
