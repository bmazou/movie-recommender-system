I'm absolutely in love with "Scarface," "Finding Nemo," and "2 Fast 2 Furious." I really enjoyed "The Longest Yard," "The Conjuring 2," and "Chicken Little." "Resident Evil: Afterlife" was just okay for me, but I didn't really enjoy "X-Men: The Last Stand." Currently, I'm in a mood for an origin story of a vigilante hero in a gritty urban setting.
