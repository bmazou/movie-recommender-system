I absolutely loved "Interstellar," "Inception," "The Dark Knight Rises," and "The Professional." I also really enjoyed "Iron Man 3" and "Skyfall." "The Terminator" was just okay for me, and "The Lego Movie" wasn’t all that great in my opinion. Currently, I'm in a mood for a quirky comedy centered around a laid-back slacker.
