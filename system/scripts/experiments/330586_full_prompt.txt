I absolutely loved "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King" and "The Troll Hunter (Trolljegeren)." I really enjoyed "Willow," "The Silence of the Lambs," and "Frozen." "How to Train Your Dragon 2" and "Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan" were quite good too. "The Hunger Games" was okay for me. Currently, I'm in a mood for a classic crime drama centered around a powerful mafia family.
